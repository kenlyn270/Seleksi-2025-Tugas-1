The crust is very thin at the base, and the dough puffs up on the sides, which results in airy crust that should have typical charred leopard spots if baked properly. The origins of this iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples. Almost 200 years later, in 1889, the premier Neapolitan master pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito added mozzarella to the mix and invented the margherita, which is now generally cited as the first modern pizza. Originally dubbed la pizza tricolore, Espositos creation is said to have been made in honor of and named after Margherita of Savoy, the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy, who was visiting Naples at the time. In 2010, as one of Italys most popular foods worldwide, pizza Napoletana was officially recognized by the European Union and granted the designation of Traditional Specialty Guaranteed. And remember, a good pizza Napoletana doesnt need any additions other than the designated toppings.",

The meat is seasoned with salt, pepper, and maybe a bit of cayenne or garlic powder. It is then cooked in offset smokers, while the heat and smoke from the fire go across the meat, adding an irresistible smoky flavor to the brisket (although shoulder clod, chuck short ribs, and larger short ribs are also popular). The meat is carved in front of the customer, and it is traditionally served on butcher paper (as an homage to the meat markets of yore), most often without any type of barbecue sauce on the side.",

The origins of tiramis are heavily disputed between Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, but it is often suggested that the first was made in Veneto in the early 1960s. The earliest documented recipe for tiramis (interestingly, without alcohol!) was printed in the 1981 spring edition of Vin Veneto magazine in an article on coffee-based desserts by Giuseppe Maffioli, a renowned food critic and member of the Italian Academy of Cuisine. However, in August 2017, Friuli-Venezia Giulias tiramisu was officially added to the list of traditional regional dishes, but a Veneto local won the Tiramisu World Cup in November 2017, so the playing field is somewhat levelled once again. Regardless of these disputes, the perfect tiramis should always deliver a serious caffeine kick from a shot of strong espresso, while brandy-fortified Marsala wine adds a nice sweet buzz.

Bianyifang, Beijings oldest restaurant specializing in Peking duck has been in business since the Jiajing reign of the 16th century, serving as a testament to the popularity of this succulent, tantalizing dish. The duck is cooked until the skin turns golden and crispy and the meat becomes tender, slightly sweet, and moist. Both the meat and the skin are then folded in thin pancakes or steamed white buns. To make an authentic Beijing kao ya, the duck must be a white feathered American Pekin, hung for 24 hours, and pumped with air through a small puncture between the breasts and wings. It is usually brushed with a mixture of ginger, oil, hoisin sauce, honey, and rice vinegar, then vertically hung and slowly roasted to perfection. When the dish is served, the skin will often come first as an appetizer, followed by the meat which is accompanied by cucumbers, scallions, hoisin sauce, buns, and pancakes. With its 400-year history, exquisite flavors, and elaborate preparation, it comes as no surprise that Peking duck is one of the most famous Chinese dishes.",

The meat, most commonly minced pork or beef, is also commonly included, but mainly acts as a garnish. In China, the varieties differ only slightly, but worldwide the traditional dan dan noodles have been adjusted to the more gentle western palate and use significantly fewer spices. The dish originated in the Sichuan province, and it is still one of the most common dishes in the area. The name itself comes from the way the noodles were initially offered to the Sichuan citizens and refers to the bamboo pole carried on the shoulders, which was used to transport the dish through the city streets.

This cut consists of two different muscles: the pectoralis major, known as the \"flat,\" and the pectoralis minor, or the \"point.\" The flat is leaner, while the point has more fat and marbling. Because of the high amount of connective tissue, brisket needs to be cooked slowly, over low heat, to allow the collagen in the meat to break down and become tender. This makes it a popular choice for slow cooking methods like smoking, braising, or slow roasting.

Moreover, gricia is said to have originated in Grisciano, a small hamlet not far from Amatrice, the birthplace of spaghetti allamatriciana. These two mountain towns nestled in the Apennine peaks between the neighboring regions of Lazio and Abruzzo have long been known as home to semi-nomadic shepherds, who were often credited with inventing this simple sauce. While tending herds during their long months of transhumance, the shepherds used guanciale (cured pork jowl) and tangy pecorino cheese tossed with pasta to prepare quick and humble meals like cacio e unto (lit. cheese and lard), as gricia sauce was once called. Even today, the list of ingredients goes no further than guanciale, pecorino, and black pepper more than enough to result in the divine flavor of pasta alla gricia, which is typically served with bucatini, spaghetti, or rigatoni.",

Saganaki is sometimes enlivened by a splash of traditional Greek spirits like Metaxa brandy or Ouzo, an anise-flavored aperitif. Outside of Greece, particularly in the US, saganaki is typically flamb ed at the table, and this flaming culinary showmanship is a tradition which reportedly first started in Chicagos Greektown.
