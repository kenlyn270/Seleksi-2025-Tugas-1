One pizza is one serving, and the number of pizzas that can be made with the amounts stated here ranges from eight to eleven, depending on the amount of flour the water absorbs, which changes daily. That said, if you are not making a huge batch, half a liter (2 1/4 cups) of water makes for approximately five to seven pizzas, so adjust the amounts accordingly. If you do not own a wood-fired oven but want good results, apply the suggestions from our \"at-home preparation\" tip."
